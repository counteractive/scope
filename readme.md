# SCOPE - STIX Custom Objects, Proposals, and Extensions

A repository and namespace for STIX custom objects and extensions, as well as proposals for how they could be used.  Because we see opportunities to expand the _scope_ of STIX's influence in infosec, naturally.

This is intended for discussion and evaluation, to try to find any devils in the details.

**Caveat:** Please consider this alpha content, not (yet) intended for production use.  However, all customizations are [compliant with the STIX 2.1 spec](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070825), so it shouldn't break anything to try it out.

## Goals

1. Support wider adoption of STIX data abstractions in detection and response.  
    
    A very modest expansion of observable types and relationships will go a long way here - this namespace includes two new observable types to describe systems and sessions.

1. Support improved data source documentation and relationships in MITRE ATT&CK.

    Capturing object _types_ (vs. just instances) as first-class STIX domain objects lets us capture useful metadata (like data sources!) and empowers more flexible relationships.  Using a single custom domain object type we show how this could work, along with some of its specific benefits.

## Constraints

1. Stay within the latest STIX spec to leverage its strengths, avoid standards proliferation, and maximize consistency with ATT&CK.
1. Propose the minimum number of customizations necessary to meet the goals (i.e., the "minimum effective dose").
1. Incorporate lessons from other prior art.

## Background

The Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) is an open specification for sharing cyber threat intelligence (CTI) maintained by the [OASIS](https://www.oasis-open.org/) CTI technical committee (TC).  STIX provides consistent abstractions and a prescriptive exchange format for cyber threat activity, and it's the canonical format for the popular [MITRE ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.

We love STIX, but we've run into two limitations:

1. **STIX v2.1 chose to limit its catalog of observable object types, omitting certain types useful for detection and response.**  

    A STIX working document captured this comment by [Rich Struse](https://www.oasis-open.org/people/distinguished-contributor/richard-struse):

    > "while I understand that organizations want and need to track specific assets that were impacted by an event, I find it hard to imagine the general-purpose use-case where organizations are sharing such info widely. As such, it seems out of scope for a CTI exchange format."

    We appreciate the desire to manage the scope of the STIX project, but we respectfully disagree.  

    1. Security operations, digital forensics, and incident response frequently requires sharing information across organizational boundaries.  We commonly share information between departments, sister organizations, regulators, attorneys, law enforcement, vendors, customers, and more.  It just tends to be _ad hoc_, governed by whatever tools or procedures happen to be in place.
    1. STIX already has features for controlling how information should be shared (_e.g._, [TLP](https://www.cisa.gov/tlp)): it's not exclusively designed for sharing information "widely."
    1. Attacks are often launched from one organization's systems and cloud tenancies into other organizations, so the distinction between "friendly assets" and "attacker infrastructure" is already pretty blurry.
    1. It leads to arbitrary distinctions (_e.g._, having a `user-account` observable in scope, but the system a `user-account` uses out of scope).
    1. Parallel efforts for describing "friendly" or "internal" observables would have to solve problems STIX already solved ... along with compatibility with STIX itself!

    **Bottom line:** we think the STIX model has a lot to offer beyond just CTI, particularly in the realm of detection and response, and a few custom objects would vastly increase its usefulness without unduly compromising concision.

    Fortunately STIX v2.1 supports [custom objects and extensions](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/cs01/stix-v2.1-cs01.html#_3wlhv7hxh2en), and this project respects those constraints, making it compatible with existing spec.

1. **There's no obvious way to capture data about _object types themselves_ (as opposed to _instances_ of types) within STIX.**  That is, types are not objects to which you can add "static" or "prototypical" data, nor can you refer to object types directly in relationships.

    MITRE ATT&CK's recent efforts around data sources show how it would be nice, for example, to have a STIX representation of the `process` type to which we could attach useful data (e.g., where to find concrete evidence about `process`es on a system).  
    
    Also, having _types_ as first-class STIX objects makes relationships much more powerful.  You could say things like "`tool` _t_ creates `process` objects with properties of a certain kind."

    Fortunately, with custom objects we can make this happen too!

## Custom Observable Types

### System

- System (`x-scope-system`)
    - Physical System Extension (`x-scope-physical-ext`), 
    - Virtual System Extension (`x-scope-virtual-ext`)
    - Datastore System Extension (`x-scope-datastore-ext`)
    - Appliance System Extension (`x-scope-appliance-ext`)
    - Platform System Extension (`x-scope-platform-ext`)

The concept of a "system" (_a.k.a._, host, endpoint, asset) is ubiquitous, and has an intuitive definition, something like "a logically distinct combination of hardware and software."  A system is where most observables are in fact observed: `file`, `process`, `user-account`, _etc._, are observed on systems.

Except unfortunately STIX doesn't have a type for them.  CybOX used to (called "System"), ECS does (called "Host"), and it's floated as a possibility for STIX v2.2+ in the working documents, but it's not in the current spec.

Another way to think of a system is as anything supporting sessions (see below), but regardless of the formal definition, it's a prerequisite to making STIX more relevant to detection and response.  We think it'll help the CTI use-case too.

We propose bringing it back as a new, inclusive `system` type with extensions to capture the fact that systems aren't just physical desktop boxes anymore.



### Session

- Session (`x-scope-session`)

A session is any period of interaction between an account and a system (see above).  ECS has an open RFC that captures their variety well: sessions can be local, remote, network, or more, and on any type of system (virtual, physical, appliance, _etc._).

They're characterized by an account, system, start time, and end time, though in the simplest case they may be the same (say, via a single REST call).  Also, one or the other times may be unknown.

Current related STIX fields like `user-account` first and last logon times don't give sufficient granularity to link accounts with observables in the context of detection and response, and they don't capture the reality that user accounts can access many systems.

Bringing a `session` type into the mix provides a great tool for sharing information about **timelines**, which are incredibly useful for detection, response, and CTI alike.

### API

- API (`x-scope-api`)

Application programming interfaces (APIs) are central to many adversary techniques, but there's currently no way to describe an API in STIX.  Like with `system`, there was such a type in CybOX, but it was culled.

We recommend resurrecting it, if only for its applicability to ATT&CK.

For example, when discussing or detecting ATT&CK `attack-pattern`s like [process injection](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1055/) and its sub-techniques, it's helpful to refer to specific Windows APIs and API calls.

Like `system`, `api` would benefit from an updated definition to include the breadth of modern API types, from OS system calls to RPC to REST.

## Custom Domain Objects

### STIX Type Object

- STIX Type (`x-scope-stix-type`)

This gets a little meta, but bear with us ðŸ˜ƒ: the idea is to capture details about STIX object _types_ as concrete STIX _objects_, because it's only STIX objects that can contain real data and be the target of references.

Put another way: currently the details of the `process` type live in a word document and a non-normative json schema.  They're not STIX data.  This would allow us to capture that in a STIX object itself, _a la_:

```javascript
{
    type: "x-scope-stix-type",
    id: "x-scope-stix-type--GUID-FOR-PROCESS-TYPE"
    name: "process",
    schema: /* json schema like https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/schemas/observables/process.json */
    external_references: [/* refs */]
    /* other fields */
}
```

This provides some benefits:

1. You can store data that applies to all objects of that type.  For the programmers out there, think static members in C++/Java or prototype properties in javascript.

    The specific use-case that inspired this was trying to use SCO abstractions as the basis for improving MITRE ATT&CK's data sources.  For example, it'd be useful to describe what Windows event logs would help us populate a `process` observable.  With a `type` object, one way to do this is to add this data under the `external_references` field of the `type` object corresponding to the `process` SCO.

1. Relationships (SROs) can refer to types in general rather than just instances of a type.

    It can be useful to describe the relationships of one SCO type to another: 
    
    - Some of these, like a `user-account` creating a `process`, are **embedded relationships** captured by a `_ref` field in the object - these are well-suited to `external_references` on the SCO type as noted above.  In pseudo-code:
        ```javascript
        {
            type: "x-scope-stix-type",
            id: "x-scope-stix-type--GUID-FOR-PROCESS-TYPE"
            name: "process",
            external_references: [
                {/*info about windows EID 4688 and how it supports filling the creator_user_ref field (the user-account -> process embedded relationship)*/}
            ]
        }
        ```
    - Others, like a `process` setting a `windows-registry-key`, don't have embedded `_ref`s so could be done with a new relationship object (SRO). With a first-class `type` SDO, we can create an SRO that captures this, and attach `external_references` or other fields to that SRO:
        ```javascript
        {
            type: "relationship",
            id: "relationship--GUID",
            relationship_type: "set",
            source_ref: "x-scope-stix-type--GUID-FOR-PROCESS-TYPE",
            target_ref: "x-scope-stix-type--GUID-FOR-REGISTRY-KEY-TYPE",
            external_references: [
                {/*info about sysmon EID 13 and how it links process info to registry key activity (the process -> windows-registry-key relationship, currently not embedded)*/}
            ]
        }
        ```
    
    Or as another example (unrelated to logs), let's say we wanted to express "the `attack-pattern` [Create or Modify System Process: Windows Service (T1543.003)](https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1543/003/) creates `process` observables, specifically with the extension `windows-service-ext`. The [current model](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html#_Toc16070618) doesn't allow relationships between `attack-pattern`s and observable types, but with a new `type` object you could express it easily (and with other metadata, including references).

1. You can transmit the STIX specification as STIX data.  It's like having a compiler written in the language itself.

This also supports setting constraints on concrete objects of a certain type, but that's a discussion for another day.

## Usage

The proposed objects are stored in the [objects](./objects/) directory as yaml files.  These can be transformed into a reasonable facsimile of the STIX spec format using the node script in the [render](./render/) folder.

```bash
# with nodejs installed

cd render

npm install

# right now template.ejs is the only template
# user-account.yml is a built-in, included for testing:
./render/render.js render/template.ejs objects/built-in/user-account.yml > temp/user-account.html

# custom types are stubs for now:
./render/render.js render/template.ejs objects/system/x-scope-system.yml > temp/system.html
```

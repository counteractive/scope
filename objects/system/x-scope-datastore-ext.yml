# The Datastore System extension covers systems that operate primarily as a
# flexible storage location, and documents their data storage capabilities and
# characteristics. This is not designed to describe typical local disks, but 
# rather things like file servers, databases, and cloud storage.

# While file objects are useful for specific data, these fields characterize 
# storage as a whole, including its sensitivity.

title: System Object

description: |-
  The System object represents a logically distinct computing system on which an account can have a session.  This is a broad category also known as endpoints, hosts, or assets. In addition to physical and virtual multi-purpose computers, this also describes complex applications and many network infrastructure devices.

  These are the places where most every other event or observable occurs.

      The value of this property **MUST** be x-scope-system.

  # Note: extensions are not exclusive.  For example, describing a firewall hosted on proxmox might involve two extensions (`x-scope-appliance-ext` and `x-scope-virtual-ext`), and describing a OneDrive tenancy or AWS S3 bucket might use `x-scope-platform-ext` and `x-scope-datastore-ext`.

      `x-scope-virtual-ext`
      `x-scope-datastore-ext`
      `x-scope-appliance-ext`
      `x-scope-platform-ext`

      Dictionary keys **MUST** identify the extension type by name.
      
      The corresponding dictionary values **MUST** contain the contents of the extension instance.

# The Platform System extension covers systems that are characterized by a 
# single application rather than multi-purpose use.  Platforms can run on a
# single physical system (like a web server) or they may be an amalgamation
# of many underlying systems serving a distinct application experience, 
# like software-as-a-service.  

# TODO: consider other naming options; the idea was to capture SaaS and
# other application platforms, but "Application" seemed to collide too much
# with "software" and "tool," not to mention smartphone "apps".

# Canonical examples would be O365 tenancies or multiplayer game platforms
# (see below)

# Again, this is a system, something on which a user can have a session.  In
# this model, the application might be an entire multiplayer game 
# infrastructure (sometimes used for C2 or exfil), not the individual
# installation of the game's client on a workstation -- though that workstation
# would be a system too!

# This is distinct from "tool" or "software" objects, more appropriate for 
# single running process.

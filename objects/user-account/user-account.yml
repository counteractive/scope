    property_description: |-
      The User Account object defines the following extensions. In addition to these, producers **MAY** create their own.
      
      `unix-account-ext`
      
      Dictionary keys **MUST** identify the extension type by name.
      
      The corresponding dictionary values **MUST** contain the contents of the extension instance.

  - property_name: user_id
    required: false
    property_type: string
    property_description: |-
      Specifies the identifier of the account. The format of the identifier depends on the system the user account is maintained in, and may be a numeric ID, a GUID, an account name, an email address, etc. The **user_id** property should be populated with whatever field is the unique identifier for the system the account is a member of. For example, on UNIX systems it would be populated with the UID.

  - property_name: credential
    required: false
    property_type: string
    property_description: |-
      Specifies a cleartext credential. This is only intended to be used in capturing metadata from malware analysis (e.g., a hard-coded domain administrator password that the malware attempts to use for lateral movement) and **SHOULD NOT** be used for sharing of PII.

  - property_name: account_login
    required: false
    property_type: string
    property_description: |-
      Specifies the account login string, used in cases where the **user_id** property specifies something other than what a user would type when they login.
      
      For example, in the case of a Unix account with user_id 0, the account_login might be “root”.

    required: false
    property_type: boolean
    property_description: |-
      Indicates that the account is associated with a network service or system process (daemon), not a specific individual.

title: Session Object

description: |-
  The Session object represents any distinct period of interaction between a User Account and a System.  It's characterized by an account, start time, and end time, though in the simplest case they may be the same (say, via a single REST call).  Also, one or the other may be unknown. 
  
  In a way, anything that can support a Session can be considered a System (`x-scope-system`) in this model.

type: x-scope-session

# specific_properties and examples are arrays to maintain sort order

  - property_name: type
    required: true
    property_type: string
    property_description: |-
      The value of this property **MUST** be x-scope-session.
